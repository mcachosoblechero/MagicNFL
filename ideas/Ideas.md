This is the place to note all the crazy, ridiculous ideas that will make us millionaires.
- **Scoring based on QB area:** We can frame this as a quantification problem fo the value of the pocket area for the QB. The more valuable that area is for a QB, more emphasis should the offensive line on protecting it. Furthermore, we can expect that:
   - Holding this most valuable area for the QB for the longest time is correlated with successful passes
   - Everytime another player (offensive or defensive) takes this area, the QB pays a price - effectively decreasing the changes of a successful play

The question that we are trying to answer is: __What is the value of each region for the QB?__
